During the training session there was a presentation by three speakers who represented the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths who explained their belief systems. I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say.\n\nThe Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam complete with a video. After the presentations time was provided for questions and answers. When it was my turn I directed my question to the Imam and asked: \"Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that all of the Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world. And, that by killing an infidel, which is a command to all Muslims, they are assured of a place in heaven. If that's the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?\"\n\nThere was no disagreement with my statements and without hesitation he replied, \"Non-believers!\"\n\nI responded, \"So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can go to heaven. Is that correct?\"\n\nThe expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He sheepishly replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nI then said, \"Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Pat Robertson or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to heaven.\"\n\nThe Imam was speechless.\n\nI continued, \"I also have problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me. Let me ask you a question . . . would you rather have your Allah who tell[s] you to kill me in order to go to heaven or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am going to heaven and wants you to be with me?\"\n\nYou could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame.\n\nChuck Colson once told me something that has sustained me these 20 years of prison ministry.

Seeing her shabby, unkempt appearance, the pastor guessed the reason and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday School class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus.\n\nSome two years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor tenement buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn and crumpled purse was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribble in childish handwriting which read, \"This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday school.\"\n\nFor two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do.\n\nCarrying this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the pulpit, he told the story of her unselfish love and devotion. He challenged his deacons to get busy and raise enough money for the larger building. But the story does not end there!\n\nA newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for a 57 cent payment.\n\nChurch members made large subscriptions. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,000.00 \u2014 a huge sum for that time (near the turn of the century). Her unselfish love had paid large dividends.\n\nWhen you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300, and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside at Sunday school time.\n\nIn one of the rooms of this building may be seen the picture of the sweet face of the little girl whose 57 cents, so sacrificially saved, made such remarkable history. Alongside of it is a portrait of her kind pastor, Dr. Russell H. Conwell, author of the book, Acres of  Diamonds \u2014 a true story.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via the Internet, 1999","claimant":"","date":1466985600000,"label":0,"related_articles":[113323,160049],"id":4410},{"claim":"\"We have no knowledge of any of this.\"","claimant":"Hope Hicks","date":1478217600000,"label":0,"related_articles":[60163,58176,61335,60925,59415,61328],"id":8208},{"claim":"Facebook users can receive a Bed Bath & Beyond coupon in exchange for sharing a post or taking a survey.","claimant":"","date":1514678400000,"label":0,"related_articles":[114862,125587],"id":8506},{"claim":"Says Gavin Newsom \"didn\u2019t solve the homeless problem at all\" as mayor of San Francisco, \"and it\u2019s gotten worse.\"","claimant":"John Cox","date":1538956800000,"label":1,"related_articles":[72465,48983,48984,54369,54352,91297],"id":7136},{"claim":"\"There\u2019s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections.\"","claimant":"David Brooks","date":1457222400000,"label":2,"related_articles":[89747,95485,86248,60040],"id":2009},{"claim":"An electoral map based on Facebook analytics shows Donald Trump winning the 2016 presidential election in a \"clean sweep.\"","claimant":"","date":1478217600000,"label":0,"related_articles":[105879,113925],"id":3941},{"claim":"A Japanese man was found dead months after being crushed by huge pile of pornography.","claimant":"","date":1488844800000,"label":0,"related_articles":[117032,132200],"id":4214},{"claim":"\"To this day, (the Cuban government) is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives.\"","claimant":"Paul Ryan","date":1458172800000,"label":1,"related_articles":[91888,91878,61270,62726],"id":13073},{"claim":"Ohio\u2019s lost more jobs in March than any other state in the nation.","claimant":"Mike Foley","date":1366675200000,"label":1,"related_articles":[71776,7555,73671],"id":11101},{"claim":" Florida Gov.
